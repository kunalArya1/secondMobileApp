# SecondMobileApp

A React Native demonstration app showcasing various UI components and layouts. This proje## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's explore what you can do!

The app demonstrates several key React Native concepts:

### ðŸŽ¨ UI Components Showcase

1. **Fixed Cards** (`FixedCard.tsx`): Three colorful cards showing "Top Places"
2. **Scrollable Gallery** (`ScrollableCard.tsx`): Horizontal scrolling card collection
3. **Blog Interface** (`BlogCard.tsx`): Rich content cards with image placeholders
4. **User Section** (`Home.tsx`): User details display area

### ðŸ”§ Customization

You can modify the app by editing the component files in the `/Components` directory:

- Change card colors in `FixedCard.tsx`
- Add more cards to the scrollable section in `ScrollableCard.tsx`
- Update blog content in `BlogCard.tsx`
- Modify the main layout in `App.tsx`

When you save changes, your app will automatically update thanks to [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).rves as a learning example for building mobile interfaces with React Native, featuring different types of cards, scrollable views, and interactive components.
